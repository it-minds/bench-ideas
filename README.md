# Bench project ideas
This is a list of ideas for projects you can work on while on the bench. It's a very unformal document, no idea is too stupid, or too unrealistic. The only rule is that if you start one of these projects, you make it open source, and add a link here to the repo. Feel free to add new ideas and flesh out existing ones.
